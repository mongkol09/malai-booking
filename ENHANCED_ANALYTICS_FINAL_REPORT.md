## üìà Sample Analytics Output

### **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "analysis": {
      "revenue": {
        "country": { "data": [...], "summary": {...} },
        "segment": { "data": [...], "summary": {...} },
        "channel": { "data": [...], "summary": {...} }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Predictive Analytics Sample**
```json
{
  "nextWeek": {
    "expectedRevenue": 142500,
    "expectedOccupancy": 82,
    "confidence": 87
  },
  "seasonalForecasts": [
    { "season": "Q1 2025", "revenue": 1200000, "occupancy": 68 },
    { "season": "Q2 2025", "revenue": 1450000, "occupancy": 78 }
  ]
}
```

### **Customer Segmentation**
```json
{
  "rfm": {
    "segments": [
      { "name": "Champions", "count": 850, "avgRecency": 15 },
      { "name": "Loyal Customers", "count": 1200, "avgRecency": 30 }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üéØ Advanced Filter Capabilities

### **Supported Filter Types**
- **Time-based**: Hour, day, week, month, quarter, year granularity
- **Geographic**: Countries, cities, regions, coordinate-based radius
